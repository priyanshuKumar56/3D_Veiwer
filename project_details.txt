PROJECT DETAILS: 3D MODEL VIEWER PRO
=======================================

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
A full-stack web application designed for high-performance 3D model visualization. It allows users to upload their own GLB/GLTF assets and manipulate them in a real-time, aesthetically pleasing environment.

2. DETAILED FUNCTIONALITY
-------------------------
*   3D Model Support: Specifically optimized for .glb and .gltf formats.
*   File Upload System: Multer-based backend storage with automatic duplicate detection (replaces old file if name matches) and automatic disk cleanup for missing DB records.
*   Model Normalization: Automatically centers models and scales them to a standard size upon loading, ensuring any model (regardless of origin) looks good in the viewport.
*   Interactive Controls: Full OrbitControls (Rotate, Zoom, Pan) with smooth damping animations.
*   Material Editor:
    - Real-time color HEX changes.
    - Wireframe toggle mode.
    - 8 Material Presets: Chrome, Brushed Metal, Plastic, Glass, Matte, Ceramic, Rubber, and Default.
*   Lighting & Environment:
    - Custom light color control.
    - 7 HDRI Environment Presets: Studio, Night, City, Sunset, Dawn, Forest, and None.
*   Annotation Engine:
    - Click-to-place pin system.
    - Unique ID tracking for each pin.
    - Title and Description support for each point of interest on the 3D mesh.
*   Settings Persistence: Saves the current view state (background color, model URL, etc.) to MongoDB so it persists across refreshes.
*   Responsive Design: Optimized for both Desktop and Mobile viewing.

3. TECH STACK
-------------
*   FRONTEND:
    - React 19 (UI Library)
    - Vite (Build Tool / Dev Server)
    - Three.js (3D Engine)
    - @react-three/fiber (React bridge for Three.js)
    - @react-three/drei (High-level 3D component library)
    - Tailwind CSS v4 (Styling)
    - Framer Motion (Entrance & UI animations)
    - Lucide React (Vector icons)
    - Axios (HTTP Requests)
*   BACKEND:
    - Node.js (Runtime)
    - Express.js (Web Framework)
    - Multer (File upload middleware)
    - Mongoose (MongoDB object modeling)
    - Dotenv (Environment variable management)
*   DATABASE:
    - MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Database)

4. HOSTING & DEPLOYMENT
-----------------------
*   FRONTEND HOSTING: Vercel
    - Domain: https://3-d-veiwer-hy6m.vercel.app
    - Handles static assets and React routing.
*   BACKEND HOSTING: Render
    - Domain: https://threed-veiwer.onrender.com
    - Handles API requests, MongoDB connections, and file storage for uploads.
*   DATABASE HOSTING: MongoDB Atlas
    - Provides a global, managed NoSQL database cluster.

5. KEY CONFIGURATIONS
---------------------
*   CORS Strategy: Restrictive allowedOrigins list including Vercel domain to prevent unauthorized API access.
*   Absolute Indexing: Fixed the production "Unexpected Token <" error by ensuring all model URLs are prefixed with the backend's absolute URL (API_BASE_URL) instead of relative paths.
*   Auto-Save: 800ms debounce timer in the settings hook to prevent DB flooding during rapid color changes.
