use my exting setupp and build into that   3D Product Viewer — Complete Feature & System Breakdown
Let me walk you through everything, exactly how it should look, feel, and work — from the moment a user opens the app to every feature they interact with.

What You're Building (Big Picture)
Think of it as a mini Sketchfab clone — a web app where someone can upload a 3D model, spin it around in the browser, customize how it looks, and have those settings saved automatically. The reference sites (arnxt.com and quleep.in) are AR/3D product visualization platforms, so the vibe is clean, modern, professional — like a tool a product designer or e-commerce brand would use.

How the App Looks & Flows (Complete UI System)
Page 1 — Landing / Onboarding Screen
When a user first opens the app, they should NOT be dropped directly into a blank viewer. Instead there's a clean landing experience:
What they see:

A dark-themed page (dark backgrounds work best for 3D viewers — the model pops)
A big headline like "Visualize Your Product in 3D"
A short subline explaining what the app does in one sentence
A large drag-and-drop upload zone in the center — a dashed border box that says "Drop your GLB file here or click to browse"
Below it, a small note saying supported formats: .glb, .gltf
Optionally a "Load Sample Model" button so users can try it without uploading anything

Feel: Clean, minimal, inviting. Like Figma's welcome screen or Dropbox's upload page.
What happens: User drops a file → loading spinner appears → they get taken to the Viewer Screen.

Page 2 — The Main Viewer Screen (Core of the App)
This is the biggest, most important screen. It's split into two zones:
Zone A — 3D Canvas (Left / Center, ~75% of screen)
This is a full WebGL canvas powered by Three.js. The 3D model renders here. It fills most of the screen. The background of this canvas changes based on the color picker.
Zone B — Control Panel (Right sidebar, ~25% of screen)
A vertical panel on the right side with all controls. Dark card, slightly lighter than the canvas background.

Every Feature Explained in Detail
Feature 1 — 3D Model Viewer (Mandatory, 20% weight)
What it does: Renders the uploaded GLB/GLTF 3D model inside a WebGL canvas using Three.js.
How it looks: The model appears centered on the canvas, properly sized and lit. It just sits there looking good — like a product on a studio shelf.
Controls the user gets:

Rotate — Click and drag on the canvas to spin the model around any axis. This is called OrbitControls in Three.js. The model rotates smoothly following the mouse.
Zoom — Scroll wheel zooms in and out. On mobile it's pinch-to-zoom.
Pan — Right-click drag (or two-finger drag on mobile) moves the camera sideways/up-down without rotating. Useful when zoomed in.

Lighting setup (behind the scenes but visible):

Ambient Light — Fills the whole scene with soft base light so no part of the model is pitch black. Think of it like the general room lighting.
Directional Light — Acts like a sun/spotlight coming from one direction, creating highlights and shadows that make the model look 3D and real, not flat.

Why this matters for evaluation: The interviewer wants to see you understand 3D space — camera positioning, lighting, model scaling, and smooth controls. This is 20% of your score.

Feature 2 — Upload 3D Model (Mandatory)
What it does: Lets the user pick a .glb or .gltf file from their computer and load it into the viewer.
Two parts:

Frontend upload UI — A button or drag-drop zone in the control panel (or on the landing page). When clicked, it opens the file picker. After selection, the file is sent to the backend API.
Backend upload API — Your Node/Express server receives the file, saves it to a local /uploads folder on the server, and sends back a URL like http://yourserver.com/uploads/model123.glb. The frontend then loads this URL into Three.js.

How it looks in the UI:

A button labeled "Upload Model" with a file icon
After upload, a small success message or the model just appears
Maybe a tiny filename label like "sneaker.glb — loaded"
If something goes wrong, a friendly error toast (red notification at top)

Edge cases to handle:

File too large? Show an error.
Wrong format? Reject it before sending.
Loading a new model replaces the old one cleanly.


Feature 3 — Background Color Picker (Mandatory)
What it does: Changes the background color of the 3D canvas in real time.
How it looks: A row in the control panel labeled "Background" with a color swatch next to it. Clicking the swatch opens a color picker popup (can use the native HTML <input type="color"> or a library like react-colorful for something nicer).
Behavior:

As soon as the user picks a color, the canvas background updates instantly — no page refresh, no button click needed.
Default color on load is something nice — dark charcoal #1a1a2e or pure black.
This setting gets saved to the backend (explained in Feature 5).

Why it matters: It's part of "viewer settings" the backend stores. Simple but important for the full-stack loop.

Feature 4 — Wireframe Mode Toggle (Mandatory)
What it does: Switches the 3D model's appearance between solid (normal) and wireframe (shows only the edges/skeleton of the model as lines).
How it looks:

A toggle switch in the control panel labeled "Wireframe Mode"
OFF: Model looks normal with colors/textures
ON: Model becomes a mesh of lines, you can see through it, shows the geometry structure

Behavior: Instantly switches on click. No reload. Looks really cool on complex models — shows your technical chops.
How it works under the hood: You traverse all mesh objects in the Three.js scene and set material.wireframe = true/false. This setting also gets saved to the backend.

Feature 5 — Save Viewer Settings to Backend (Mandatory)
What it does: Every time the user changes background color or toggles wireframe, those preferences get saved to MongoDB via your API.
What gets saved:

Background color (hex code like #1a1a2e)
Wireframe state (true or false)
Timestamp (when it was saved)

How the save is triggered: Either automatically (debounced — saves 1 second after user stops changing things) or with a "Save Settings" button. Auto-save feels more polished.
How it looks in UI: A small "Settings saved ✓" confirmation message briefly appears, then fades out. OR a persistent "Last saved: 2 min ago" text at the bottom of the panel.

Feature 6 — Fetch/Load Saved Settings (Mandatory)
What it does: When the app loads, it calls the backend and gets back the last saved settings, then applies them automatically.
User experience: User comes back to the app next time → their background color is restored, wireframe mode is set to what it was before. Feels like the app remembers them.
How it looks: Nothing visible — it just works. The canvas background is already set to their saved color when the viewer loads. No jarring default-then-change flash.

The Control Panel — Complete Layout
Here's exactly what the right sidebar contains, top to bottom:
Header: App logo or name, maybe a small tagline.
Section 1 — Model

Upload button (with file icon)
Current filename display
Maybe a small thumbnail or polygon count

Section 2 — Environment

Background color picker with label
(Bonus) HDRI environment dropdown

Section 3 — Display

Wireframe toggle switch
(Bonus) Material/texture changer

Section 4 — Settings

Save button or auto-save status
Last saved timestamp

Footer:

App version or branding


Bonus Features (5% but impressive)
Bonus 1 — Material / Texture Change
A dropdown or set of swatches in the panel that lets users apply a different color or texture to the model's surface. For example, change a shoe from red to blue. Uses Three.js material.color.set() or swapping texture maps.
Looks like: A row of colored circles the user can click, like color options on an e-commerce product page.
Bonus 2 — HDRI Environment
Instead of a flat background color, load an HDRI image (a 360° photo of a room, studio, or outdoor scene) that wraps around the model and reflects onto its surface. Makes metallic/shiny models look stunning and photorealistic.
Looks like: A dropdown in the panel — "Environment: Studio / Sunset / Warehouse / None" — and the background + reflections change.
Bonus 3 — Hotspots / Annotations
Clickable markers that float on specific points of the 3D model. When clicked, they show a tooltip with info like "This is the heel cushion — Air Zoom technology". Like the annotation system on Sketchfab.
Looks like: Small pulsing dot icons on the model. Click → popup card with title and description appears.

The Full User Journey (Start to Finish)

User opens the app → sees the landing/upload screen
They drag a GLB file onto the upload zone
File uploads to backend → URL returned
App transitions to the viewer screen — model appears in center, spinning gently (optional auto-rotate)
User drags to rotate → zooms → pans → explores the model
User clicks the background color picker → changes it to a light grey
Canvas background updates instantly
Settings auto-save → "Saved ✓" flash appears
User toggles wireframe ON → model turns into a wire mesh
Settings save again
User closes the tab, comes back tomorrow
App fetches saved settings → loads with the same grey background and wireframe still on


Visual Design Direction
Theme: Dark, cinematic, professional. Think Three.js/Spline aesthetic.
Colors: Very dark background (#0a0a0f), white model, electric blue or orange accents for UI elements.
Typography: Clean, modern, slightly technical — something like Sora, Space Grotesk, or similar.
Animations: Smooth model load animation (fade in + slight scale up). Panel elements slide in on load. Toggles have smooth transitions.
Inspiration: Spline.design viewer, Sketchfab embed player, Apple AR Quick Look.
